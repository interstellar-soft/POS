# POS Frontend

This is a minimal React frontend using Tailwind CSS loaded from CDN. It
demonstrates navigation similar to Loyverse POS with pages for Dashboard,
Products, Sales, Inventory and Login.

To run in development, serve the `public` folder using any static server:

```bash
npx serve public
```

The frontend expects the backend API to be available at `/api`.
